# data-science-beginners

This is a 5-day R programming bootcamp for beginners I created when I taught it at Essex in 2022. When saying beginners, it refers to people with zero programming background. If you see yourself with no background, this is probably a good short course for you. 

## How to proceed
You should follow the daily lecture slides (the html files under the Lecture folder) by reading through the slides while listening to my recorded lectures. Then, you can practice what you have learned by doing daily exercises, which are located under the Lab folder. When you do exercises, the best approach is to make attempts by yourself first and then go to the answer keys.
